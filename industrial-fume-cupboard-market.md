<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Fume Cupboard Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Cupboard</li><li>Ducted Fume Cupboard</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial Fume Cupboard market is primarily categorized into Ductless and Ducted fume cupboards. Ductless fume cupboards filter hazardous fumes through internal HEPA or activated carbon filters, allowing for recirculation of purified air within the laboratory. This type is ideal for spaces lacking external exhaust capabilities. Conversely, ducted fume cupboards vent harmful fumes directly to the outside environment through ventilation systems, ensuring better removal of contaminants. Both types offer protection, but their suitability depends on the laboratory's layout and safety requirements.</p></p>
