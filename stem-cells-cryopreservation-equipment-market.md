<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cells Cryopreservation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell cryopreservation equipment refers to the tools and technologies used to store stem cells at ultra-low temperatures. The market is divided into two primary types: liquid phase and vapor phase. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves direct immersion of samples in liquid nitrogen, ensuring even cooling and rapid cryoprotectant diffusion. Vapor phase, on the other hand, stores samples above the liquid nitrogen level, providing a more controlled cooling rate, which can help mitigate cellular damage and improve viability post-thawing.</p></p>
